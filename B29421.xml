            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>May it please Your Sacred Majesty,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE have good Reason to believe that Your Majesties just Commands shall never be obstructed by the Unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, nor retarded by the Negligence of the Subjects of This Your Majesties Ancient Kingdom, being fully convinced, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is required of us, save that we may preserve our selves by suitable and easie Means, against those formidable and eminent Dangers, which threaten us now from the same Principles, by which we were formerly Ruined; So that the only thing which is forced upon the worst of Your Ruined; So that the only thing which is forced upon the worst of Your Subjects, is, that they must unavoidably confess, that nothing can lessen their happiness, except their being unsensible of it. And Your Majesty by dispensing for our Protection, all the Revenue which is raised in This Your Majesties Ancient Kingdom, lets us see, that all you crave of us, is, that we would be true to our own Interest, and that You get by us, is, the Care of Governing us to our own Satisfaction. That profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and sincere Kindness, Sir, which we observe in Your Majesties Subjects here, to Your Royal Brother, the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> assure us, that we want nothing but occasion to hazard for the Royal Family, these Lives and Fortunes which You have already made so sweet
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:186091:2"/>and secure us. And as our esteem for His Royal Highness at His last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here, grew daily with His Stay, so our expectations of Security and Satisfaction return naturally with Him. And therefore we are obliged with all Zeal and Sincerity to return Your Sacred Majesty our most Humble aad Hearty Thanks for securing the Just and Natural Descent of that Royal Family, which is the chief Glory and only Security of This Kingdom, upon which the least Invasion would be so great an Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all Insolence and Arbitrariness in Your Subjects, as could not but procure us a Civil War in every Age; For men of Parts and Inrerests be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discontented or Factious, would, by promoting colourable Titles and Pretences, make the Body of Your People the Price of their Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and the Prey of their Ambition, and rent, not only these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms from one another, but amongst themselves: Nor can we see why every Man may not pretend to be King, when the lawful Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors are debarred, nor how we can be fixed in any thing, when we lose this great Fundamental. And in the next Place, we do likewise return Your Majesty most Humble and Hearty Thanks, for sending your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Brother to be an Example to, as well as a Witness of our Loyalty, and affording us in him the renewed Occasion of letting the World see that no Humour nor Jealousies shall for the future divert that Dutifulness to the Royal Line, which our Predecessors have maintained for so many Ages. Nor doubt we very shortly to let vour Majesty find, what happy Effects His stay here will produce for promoting your Service, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting our Differences, in all which His Royal Highness shall be most obsequiously assisted, By,</p>
